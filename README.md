This project includes a python file that runs different tests to analyze certain outcomes when it comes to working with numbers and letters. Also included in the repository is a text file titled words which contains most dictionary words. This text file will be referenced throughout the python file. The numbers used within this project were manually input into the code and the test takes them and adds up all of the integers that make that number. For example, five would have an outcome of 15 as the test would then add one, two, three, four, and five.

The following tests are all related to working to letters and words. One test takes a group of letters that can be changed within the code. This group of letters is then scanned in its original order to verify if it currently makes a word or not. It will then display a short message indicting if it is a word or not along with a timestamp indicating the processing time for each. 

Next would be a function that takes two string inputs and compares them against one another to see if the first input which is a word can be made from the second string input which is a group of random letters. Similar to the function above, the outcome will explain if the word can be made or not and then displays another processing timestamp.

The final two functions read back to the words text file to check a manual coded input of a random group of letters. After running its test, the outcome within the terminal will display all of the words that can be created just from that group of letters. Another timestamp indicating processing timeframe can be found at the bottom of both test results within the terminal.


PLEASE NOTE: I am only able to run the file by using a debugger. Any help or guidance on this would be greatly appreciated.
